# Favicon Instructions

To complete the setup, you need to add a favicon.ico file to the static directory. You can:

1. Use any existing favicon.ico file you have
2. Generate one using online tools like favicon.io
3. Convert your logo to favicon.ico format

The file should be placed in this directory (static/) and named exactly 'favicon.ico'.

For now, you can use any standard favicon generator to create a simple PayZen favicon and place it here.
